### Hello World! How you doing? ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felipe Farias from Brazil. I've been work as full stack engineer since 2018.

I always loved technology and to start my carreer I resolved study Computer Engineer at UNIFEI. 

Since my graduate I don't stop study and my actual development stack is: Java and SpringBoot, Docker, Jenkins and GCP.
